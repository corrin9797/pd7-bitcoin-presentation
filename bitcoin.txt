Well, I had presentation notes on note cards, but I can't turn them into documents.

So, disorganized facts about Bitcoin GO!

How it works (bonus points for it being open source):

	- Think of it kind of like a check, but your signature uses public and private keys instead of your hand.

	- So, the way you check if a signature is valid is by using the public key to decript
		the "signature" and the associated hash function on the data. If they match,
		it's valid.

	- Technically speaking, you don't have to pay a fee in order for your transaction to be verified.
		But the miners that do that work will speed up the process if you do.

	- Call your personal bitcoin wallet a credit card if you like, but the fact rmains that it's harder to track
		who sells what on the bitcoin market. And yes, this has caused problems for bitcoin but they're willing
		to work with law enforcement, so you should probably stick to hard cash when you're trying to cover up
		your drug business.

Economics:

	-OH DEAR GOD THE VOLATILITY. Think something along the lines of gold... except seven times stronger.
		-For the non-market-savvy, high volatility just means that the price tends to vary wildly.

	-Some people think it's a bubble. Considering the value of Bitcoin has risen on Log scale, I'm inclined to believe them.
		-A bubble: think of tulips in holland. And it's treated as a currency, so just like the ruble, bitcoin can die.

	-Others have accused it of being a ponzi scheme. This is far more contentious, though I am inclined
		to see the accusers as the same sort of people who said that the internet would never catch on.

	-SO, to wrap up, many economists don't like bitcoin, and think it's either basically worthless or outright criminal. My response:

		-Yes, it's somewhat fictional, but so is gold.

		-Criminal? Absolutely not. Hell, Richard Stallman thinks it's not anonymous enough. It might be
			financially risky, but that's no reason to link it to ill intent.

Politics:

	-Naturally, libertarians love a financial transaction system independent of a governement. Decide for yourself whether
		that's an inherent virtue.

	-The above also appeals to conservatives wary of big goverment.

	-Liberals, meanwhile, appreciate that Bitcoin is somewhat independent of big financial institutions. I guess there's some thing for everyone.



So, that's basically it.

P.S. I'm still not sure why I wasn't working with my other period 7 bitcoin person on this, but whatever. I prefer working alone anyway.
